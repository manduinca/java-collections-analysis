# Java Collections #

A little review.

## Basic Data Structures ##

### Array ###

* Lineal structure
* Fast access by index
* Slow insert by index
* Slow remove by index

### Linked List ###

* Lineal structure
* Slow access by index
* Fast insert by iterator
* Fast remove by iterator

### Hash Table ###

* No lineal structure
* Fast insert and remove
* Fast search

## Measuring Java Collections performance ##

### Stage 1 ###

Many access operations.
Some insert and remove operations.

### Stage 2 ###

Many insert and remove operations.
some access operations.

### Stage 3 ###

Many search operations. For example [Two sum problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/).
